        SHARED SPOON-FEEDING SCHEME was founded in 2020 in Soweto with the goal of combating hunger and malnutrition in vulnerable persons and families. The initiative, founded by a group of community volunteers, began by serving hot meals twice a week to a small group of homeless people. Over time, it has evolved into a well-organized operation that serves hundreds of meals every week while collaborating with local farmers, bakers, and schools to ensure that no one goes hungry in the community.
